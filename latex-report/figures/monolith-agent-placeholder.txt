Монолит агентын архитектур

User -> Orchestrator Agent
Orchestrator -> Knowledge Agent (tight coupling)
Orchestrator -> Investment Agent (tight coupling)
Orchestrator -> News Agent (tight coupling)
Orchestrator -> Transaction Agent (tight coupling)

NxM connections between all agents
If one agent fails -> cascading failure to all dependent agents

Replace with actual diagram showing:
- User connecting to Orchestrator
- Orchestrator having direct connections to all agents
- NxM tight coupling issue illustrated
- Red X showing failure propagation
